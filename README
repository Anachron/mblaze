NAME
     mintro – Santoku introduction

DESCRIPTION
     The Santoku message system is a set of Unix utilities to deal with mail
     kept in Maildir folders.

     Its design is roughly inspired by MH, the RAND Message Handling System,
     but its is a complete implementation from scratch.

     Santoku consists of a set of Unix tools that each do one job:
     maddr(1)    to extract addresses from mail
     mcomp(1)    to write and send mail
     mdirs(1)    to find Maildirs
     mflag(1)    to change flags (marks) of mail
     mhdr(1)     to extract mail headers
     minc(1)     to incorporate new mail
     mless(1)    to conveniently read mail in less(1)
     mlist(1)    to list and filter mail messages
     mmime(1)    to create MIME messages
     mrepl(1)    to reply to mail
     mscan(1)    to generate single line summaries of mail
     mseq(1)     to deal with mail sequences
     msetseq(1)  to set the mail sequence
     mshow(1)    to render mail and extract attachments
     msort(1)    to sort mail
     mthread(1)  to arrange mail into discussions

PRINCIPLES
     Santoku is a classic command line MUA with no features related to
     receiving and transferring mail.  You are expected to fetch your mail
     using offlineimap(1), fdm(1), procmail(1), getmail(1) or similar and send
     it using sendmail(8), as provided by OpenSMTPD, Postfix, msmtp(1), dma(8)
     or similar.  Santoku expects your mail to reside in Maildir folders.

     Santoku operates directly on Maildir and doesn't use caches or database.
     There is no setup needed for many uses.  All tools have been written with
     performance in mind.  Enumeration of all mails in a Maildir is avoided
     unless necessary, and then optimized to use few syscalls.  Parsing mail
     metadata is optimized to use few I/O requests.  Initial operations on big
     Maildir may feel slow, but as soon as they are in cache, everything is
     blazing fast.  The tools are written to be memory efficient (i.e. not
     wasteful), but whole messages are assumed to fit into RAM easily (at a
     time).

     Santoku has been written from scratch and tested on a big pile of
     personal mail, but is not actually 100% RFC conforming (which is neither
     worth it nor desirable).  There may be issues with very old,
     nonconforming, messages.

     Santoku is written in portable C, using only POSIX functions (apart from
     a tiny Linux-only optimization).  It supports MIME and more than 7-bit
     messages (everything the host iconv(3) can decode).  It assumes you work
     in a UTF-8 environment.  Santoku works well together with other Unix mail
     tools such as offlineimap(1), mairix(1), or mu(1).

EXAMPLES
     Santoku tools are designed to be composed together into a pipe.  It is
     suitable for interactive use and for scripting.  It integrates well into
     a Unix workflow.

     For example, you could decide you want to look at all unseen mail in your
     INBOX, oldest first.
           mlist -s ~/Maildir/INBOX | msort -d | mscan
     To operate on a set of mails in multiple steps, you can save a list of
     mail as a sequence.  E.g. add a call to ‘msetseq’ to above command:
           mlist -s ~/Maildir/INBOX | msort -d | msetseq | mscan
     Now mscan will show message numbers and you could look at the first five
     mails at once, for example:
           mshow 1:5
     Likewise, you could decide to look at all freshly received mail in all
     folders, thread it and look at it interactively:
           mdirs ~/Maildir | xargs minc | mthread | mless
     Or you could look at the attachments of the 20 largest mails in your
     INBOX:
           mlist ~/Maildir/INBOX | msort -s | tail -20 | mshow -t
     Or apply the patches from the current mail:
           mshow -O. '*.diff' | patch
     As usual with pipes, the sky is the limit.

CONCEPTS
     Santoku deals with messages (which are files), folders (which are Maildir
     folders), sequences (which are newline-seperated lists of messages,
     possibly persisted on disk in ~/.santoku/map), and the current message
     (kept as a symlink in ~/.santoku/cur).

     Messages in the persisted sequence can be referred to using special
     syntax as explained in mmsg(7).

     Many utilities have a default behavior when used interactively from a
     terminal (e.g. operate on the current message or the current sequence).
     For scripting, you must make these arguments explicit.
